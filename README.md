Any issues you encountered:

The instructions were clear and straightforward, however I still ran into a few issues during the set up process. During milestone 1, the "firewall creation" process was taking a long time and I was unable to access the MHN admin console in my browser during milestone 4.This was my first time using google cloud program so I had the opportunity to understand the different tools and how to initialize it. I also was having a hard time using nmap. For some reason, I was unable to brew install nmap to pass it the IP of the honeypot VM.


A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc:

Number of Attacks : 

Number of Malware Samples: 

Top Destination Ports : 

Top 5 Protocols : 


Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected:

I think it would be interesting to observe the data collected as the the number of days since the original date of deployment increased. 

Additionally, include a json export of the data you collected in the repo. Please see below for the file.
